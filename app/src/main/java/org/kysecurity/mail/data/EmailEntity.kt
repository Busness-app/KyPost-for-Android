/** Keyed by folder **and** [messageId]: the relay's id is an IMAP UID, unique only within one
 *  mailbox, so INBOX and Archive can both hold `42`. A single-column key let a refresh of either
 *  folder overwrite or relocate the other's row.
 *
 *  ponytail: still not UIDVALIDITY-aware — the relay does not expose it, and a client cannot
 *  invent it. A UIDVALIDITY reset therefore leaves rows keyed to ids the server has reused; the
 *  daily full resync (`MailFetchResult.isFullWindow`) rewrites the window and prunes the rest,
 *  so the damage self-heals within a day. Upgrade path: have the relay return UIDVALIDITY (or a
 *  stable opaque id) and add it to this key.
