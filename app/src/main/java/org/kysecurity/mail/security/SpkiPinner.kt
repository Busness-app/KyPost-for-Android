     *  `CertificatePinner` passes when ANY chain member matches ANY configured pin. That single
     *  fact rules out every issuer in the chain, not just the root:
     *
     *  - A pinned public ROOT admits every certificate that root has ever issued or ever will.
     *  - A pinned public INTERMEDIATE is the same defect one link down, and it is the one this
     *    function used to have. For the ordinary deployment — a self-hosted relay behind Let's
     *    Encrypt — pinning R11 or E5 meant the pin asserted "issued by Let's Encrypt" and nothing
     *    more. Anyone who can answer for the host (DNS hijack, BGP, a hostile resolver, a
     *    compromised registrar) obtains their own certificate from the same CA in ninety seconds,
     *    for free, and it chains to the pinned intermediate. That is not a pin; it is WebPKI with
     *    extra steps and a UI that claims otherwise.
     *  - A pinned LEAF is a pin. It names one key.
     *
     *  The cost is real and is NOT papered over anywhere in this file: a renewal that mints a new
     *  key matches no stored pin, and every credentialed call to that host fails until the user
     *  re-trusts the server through [org.kysecurity.mail.push.PushHomeViewModel.reconnectToServer],
     *  which reopens the TOFU window WITHOUT deleting the mailbox. That ceremony is the whole
     *  renewal story. A window of previously observed leaves was tried instead and could not
     *  work: a pin this device has never seen cannot be learned from a connection the pin itself
     *  rejects, so the window never held more than the one leaf already in use.
     *
     *  An entirely self-issued chain is a single self-signed server certificate, the
     *  self-hosted-relay case, and its leaf is also its anchor: pinning it is both correct and the
     *  only option, which falls out of taking the leaf without a special case. */
