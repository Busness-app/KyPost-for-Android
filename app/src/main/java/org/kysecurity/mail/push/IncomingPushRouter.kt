/** Decides what an arriving push is, for every transport.
 *
 *  This is one object rather than a branch in each messaging service because the two copies
 *  drifted. The Firebase service checked for an MFA challenge first; the UnifiedPush service
 *  went straight to [PushPayloadParser], so a challenge arriving over UnifiedPush was read as
 *  mail, failed to parse, and was dropped with nothing shown. That was invisible for as long as
 *  the server refused to send challenges over UnifiedPush at all — it stopped being invisible
 *  when the server started encrypting those payloads and lifted the exclusion.
 *
 *  MFA is tried first, and the order is load-bearing: a challenge misread as mail renders the
 *  sign-in context as a sender and subject, with no approve or deny button anywhere. */
