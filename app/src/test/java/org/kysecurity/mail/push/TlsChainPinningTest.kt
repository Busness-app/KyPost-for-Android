/**
 * What a stored pin set means once it reaches OkHttp.
 *
 * A set written today holds ONE leaf pin. It briefly held the whole chain instead, to survive
 * certificate renewal, and that is the wrong fix for a real problem: `CertificatePinner` passes
 * when ANY chain member matches ANY configured pin, so pinning an issuer admits every certificate
 * that issuer signs. A window of previously observed leaves was the second wrong fix — a key this
 * device has never seen cannot be learned from a connection the pin itself rejects. Renewal is
 * handled by the user re-trusting the server, which does not cost them the mailbox.
 *
 * These pin down: every stored pin reaches the host, nothing unobserved is admitted, and an empty
 * pin set — which `CertificatePinner` would pass vacuously — cannot be built at all.
