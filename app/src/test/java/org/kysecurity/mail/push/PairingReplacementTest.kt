/**
 * [isAccountReplacement] answers one question for two callers: [PushSyncCoordinator.attemptPairing]
 * purges on it, and the pairing confirmation dialog warns on it. That is the point of it being a
 * single function — split, the warning drifts from what actually happens, and the drift is silent
 * because nothing about a string resource fails a build.
 *
 * `PushPairingActivity.confirmAndApplyPairing` used to or-in `isPairedNow()`, which made an
 * ordinary re-pair of the SAME account take the replace branch: the user was told another account's
 * mail and contacts were about to be erased while `attemptPairing` purged nothing. These are the
 * cases that predicate has to get right for both callers.
