# Tink's shaded protobuf parse failure
# EncryptedPrefs.isProtobufParseFailure identifies this by simpleName, because it is the one proof
# that an encrypted store's keyset is destroyed rather than the Keystore being briefly unwell.
# Renamed, that comparison never matches: release refused to reopen a store debug would have
# repaired, and the swallowed failure surfaced as "this device is not enrolled". Names only — the
# class may still be shrunk if nothing uses it. checkRuntimeMatchedClassNames enforces this.

# jakarta.mail content handlers
# META-INF/mailcap names these as strings and MailcapCommandMap loads them by name, so no bytecode
# refers to them and R8 removed all five. jakarta.activation then falls back to
# DataSourceDataContentHandler, whose getContent() returns an InputStream instead of a String or a
# MimeMultipart, and PgpMimeReader reads that as "no body at all" — which is every decrypted
# message failing to render in release while debug was fine. Members too, not just the names: they
# are reached through DataContentHandler and shrinking them leaves the class an empty shell.
#
# Listed one by one rather than `handlers.**`: the wildcard also keeps image_gif and image_jpeg,
# which reference java.awt.Image and java.awt.Toolkit and fail the build on Android. mailcap does
# not declare those, and AWT does not exist here. These five are exactly what it declares, and
# checkRuntimeMatchedClassNames holds the same five.
